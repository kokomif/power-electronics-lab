# Introduction to STM32

## What is STM32?
STM32 is a family of **32-bit microcontrollers** developed by STMicroelectronics. These microcontrollers are based on **ARM Cortex-M cores**, which are designed for embedded systems (e.g., IoT devices, robots, industrial tools). STM32 chips are widely used because they balance performance, energy efficiency, and cost.

## Key Features of STM32
1. Core Variants:
    * Different series (e.g., STM32F0, F1, F4, H7) use ARM Cortex-M0/M3/M4/M7 cores.
    * Cortex-M0: Basic, low-power.
    * Cortex-M4/M7: Advanced, with DSP/math acceleration.

2. Memory:
    * Flash memory (64 KB to 2 MB) for storing programs.
    * RAM (16 KB to 1 MB) for data processing.

3. Peripherals:
    * GPIO Pins: For digital input/output (e.g., LEDs, buttons).
    * Analog Features: ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter), DAC (Digital-to-Analog).
    * Timers: PWM generation, event counting.
    * Communication Interfaces: UART, SPI, I2C, USB, CAN, Ethernet.

4. Power Efficiency:
    * Multiple low-power modes (e.g., Sleep, Stop, Standby) to save energy.

## Why Use STM32?

* **Performance**: Fast processing for real-time applications.

* **Scalability**: Choose from hundreds of models for your project needs.

* **Ecosystem**: Free tools like STM32CubeIDE, STM32CubeMX, and libraries (HAL/LL) simplify coding.

* **Community Support**: Extensive tutorials, forums, and example codes.
